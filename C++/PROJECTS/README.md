 ```
- The very first line "cpu" aggregates the numbers in all of the other "cpuN" lines.<br/>
    These numbers identify the amount of time the CPU has spent performing different kinds of work. Time units are in USER_HZ or Jiffies (typically hundredths of a second).
    <br/>
    The meanings of the columns are as follows, from left to right:
    - 1st column : user = normal processes executing in user mode
    - 2nd column : nice = niced processes executing in user mode
    - 3rd column : system = processes executing in kernel mode
    - 4th column : idle = twiddling thumbs
    - 5th column : iowait = waiting for I/O to complete
    - 6th column : irq = servicing interrupts
    - 7th column : softirq = servicing softirqs


- The "intr" line gives counts of interrupts serviced since boot time, for each of the possible system interrupts. The first column is the total of all interrupts serviced; each subsequent column is the total for that particular interrupt.
- The "ctxt" line gives the total number of context switches across all CPUs.
- The "btime" line gives the time at which the system booted, in seconds since the Unix epoch .
- The "processes" line gives the number of processes and threads created, which includes (but is not limited to) those created by calls to the fork() and clone() system calls.
- The "procs_running" line gives the number of processes currently running on CPUs .
- The "procs_blocked" line gives the number of processes currently blocked, waiting for I/O to complete .

Calculation:<br/>
>sum up all the columns in the 1st line "cpu" :<br/>
    ( user + nice + system + idle + iowait + irq + softirq )<br/>
    this will yield 100% of CPU time<br/>
    calculate the average percentage of total 'idle' out of 100% of CPU time :<br/>
    ( user + nice + system + idle + iowait + irq + softirq ) = 100%( idle ) = X % hence<br/>
    average idle percentage <br/>
    X % = ( idle * 100 ) / ( user + nice + system + idle + iowait + irq + softirq )<br/>

>[[2]](https://www.idnt.net/en-US/kb/941772) The CPU usage can be measured over an interval of time only. This means we have to read the values from /proc/stat on a fixed interval and calculate the delta from these readings.
We can simply sum of all difference between two consecutive reads to get the time elapsed between these reads. The result is equal to multiplying USER_HZ with the number of CPUs on your system and the seconds between the reads. The difference of column 4 (idle) gives us the time spent idle. The sum minus the idle time gives us the total CPU utilization. Divided by the sum we get the percentage of CPU utilization.
