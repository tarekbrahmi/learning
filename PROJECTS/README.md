### Some projects to learn C++ ###
### `Linked List` :
- arrays vs linked list :
As arrays and linked lists are both used to store items and are linear data structures, both these structures can be used in similar ways for most of the applications.

| arrays                                          | linkedList                                   |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Arrays have fixed size                          | Linked list size is dynamic                  |
| Insertion of new element is expensive           | Insertion/deletion is easier                 |
| Random access is allowed                        | Random access not possible                   |
| Elements are at contiguous location             | Elements have non-contiguous location        |
| No extra space is required for the next pointer | Extra memory space required for next pointer |

- Linked list applications of use :
    - A linked list can be used to implement stacks and queues.
    - A linked list can also be used to implement graphs whenever we have to represent graphs as adjacency lists.
    - A mathematical polynomial can be stored as a linked list.
    - In the case of hashing technique, the buckets used in hashing are implemented using the linked lists.
    - Whenever a program requires dynamic allocation of memory, we can use a linked list as linked lists work more efficiently in this case.
