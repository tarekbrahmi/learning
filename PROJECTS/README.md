### Some projects to learn C++ ###
### `Linked List` :
- arrays vs linked list :

| arrays                                          |                                   linkedList |
| :---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------: |
| Arrays have fixed size                          |                  Linked list size is dynamic |
| Insertion of new element is expensive           |                 Insertion/deletion is easier |
| Random access is allowed                        |                   Random access not possible |
| Elements are at contiguous location             |        Elements have non-contiguous location |
| No extra space is required for the next pointer | Extra memory space required for next pointer |
